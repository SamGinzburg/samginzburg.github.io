I am a Research Scientist at Meta working on ML Compilers ([Triton](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)).

I'm most interested in programming languages and systems for GPUs. My PhD dissertation (Princeton, 2024) is on [VectorVisor](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/vectorvisor-binary-translation-scheme-throughput/docview/3112421168/se-2)&mdash;a vectorizing binary translator designed to compile existing, single-threaded WebAssembly programs and run many copies of them using a GPU.
